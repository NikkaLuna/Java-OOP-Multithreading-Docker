# Hotel Scheduling Application

## Description

This project involves modernizing a Hotel scheduling application, integrating both Java Spring backend and Angular frontend to support multilingual interfaces (English and French), diverse currency displays, and time zone conversions, with a focus on containerization using Docker for efficient deployment to cloud services.

## Features

- **Localization & Internationalization**: Supports both English and French.
- **Currency Display**: Shows reservation prices in USD, CAD, and EUR.
- **Time Zone Conversion**: Converts times between ET, MT, and UTC for live presentations.
- **Docker & Cloud Deployment**: Utilizes Docker for containerization and deployment to cloud services.

## Requirements & Development Process

- **Localization & Internationalization**: I modified the Java backend to support both English and French, complying with Canadian language laws.
- **Currency Display**: I updated the front end to show reservation prices in USD, CAD, and EUR.
- **Time Zone Conversion**: I implemented a Java method for converting times between ET, MT, and UTC, specifically for live presentations at the Landon Hotel.
- **Docker & Cloud Deployment**: I built a Dockerfile for the entire application, including all modifications, and detailed the process for deploying the application to cloud services.

## Tasks

- **Application Installation**: I set up the Hotel scheduling application in my IDE, IntelliJ.
- **Resource Bundles**: I created and applied resource bundles in both English and French for welcome messages.
- **Front End Modification**: I adjusted the display of currency rates on the front end.
- **Time Conversion Method**: I developed and integrated a method to handle time zone differences.
- **Docker Integration**: I constructed and tested a Dockerfile for the application.
- **Cloud Deployment Strategy**: I outlined the approach for deploying the application to a cloud service, AWS.
