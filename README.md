## SCENARIO

As a software developer at a company in Toronto, Canada, specializing in hotel reservations, I was tasked with modifying a Hotel scheduling application. This project involved adapting the application to new management requirements, focusing on a user-centric approach.

The application I worked on is a robust Spring application with a Java backend and an Angular front end. To ensure consistent deployment and simplify the development process, I utilized Docker for containerization. I created a Dockerfile to package the application, including all necessary modifications, enabling easy deployment to cloud services.

## REQUIREMENTS & DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

- **Localization & Internationalization**: I modified the Java backend to support both English and French, complying with Canadian language laws.
- **Currency Display**: I updated the front end to show reservation prices in USD, CAD, and EUR.
- **Time Zone Conversion**: I implemented a Java method for converting times between ET, MT, and UTC, specifically for live presentations at the Landon Hotel.
- **Docker & Cloud Deployment**: I built a Dockerfile for the entire application, including all modifications, and detailed the process for deploying the application to cloud services.

## TASKS

1. **Application Installation**: I set up the Hotel scheduling application in my IDE, IntelliJ.
2. **Resource Bundles**: I created and applied resource bundles in both English and French for welcome messages.
3. **Front End Modification**: I adjusted the display of currency rates on the front end.
4. **Time Conversion Method**: I developed and integrated a method to handle time zone differences.
5. **Docker Integration**: I constructed and tested a Dockerfile for the application.
6. **Cloud Deployment Strategy**: I outlined the approach for deploying the application to a cloud service, AWS.
